# This is the repository for storing
# daily bars of all assets.  Each asset
# such as CL, lives in a directory, such as
# dbar/CL and maintais a global index file
# idx.npz.  This file has stores global attributes
# of that asset as well as for each
# day the attributes of the bars of that day.
# currently the global attributes include:
#     tick size, start/stop utc. (CME and ICE have
#     different start/stop time, which is important)
# Per day attributes include:
#     columes, bar_sec
# When a new hist file downloaded from IB (subject
# to all kinds of errors due to crappiness of their
# API and my code), they are added to the repo 
# day by day with the option:
# * Add:  
#   only write to the repo if that day is not there
#   This is typcially used in normal new history download
# * Update
#   Same as Add, except on an existing day, add columns
#   if not there or rows (utc of a bar) not there. 
#   This is typically used in getting new features in,
#   such as derived from L1/L2.
# * Overwrite:
#   write column to the repo, overwirte if the columns 
#   exist on that day, but keep the rest of the columns 
#   This is typically used to patch missing days or
#   periods of days
#
# Internally, it stores the daily bars into files
# of a month, with filename of yyyymm
# It will retrive and save
# 
# When retrieving, it allows an easy interface to 
# get bars:
# * getDailyBar(sday, eday, cols, barsec)
#   returns a nparray of the bars, with sample time at 
#   barsec, returned as 3-d array of day/bar/col
# * getWeeklyBar(sday, eday, cols, barsec)
#   Same, return as 3-d array of week/bar/col
